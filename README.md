<p align="center">
  I started in the job market at the family business, where I learned and fell in love with the world of electronics and photography.
  My interest in computing arose when I started to program microcontrollers and apply hardware and embedded systems projects, in the Electronics course at ETEC Aristoteles Ferreira.
  Curiosity: I created my first guitar distortion pedal which I calle "WooDistortion", because the case was made of recycled wood and had a somewhat rustic sound to me.
  During the Bacharel Course of Computer Engineering, I accumulated a lot of knowledge as every engineer knows hehehehe... And as my college also had a strong Administrative and Managerial side in its curricula, I began to understand better the organizational side of companies and projects, as well as new working methods such as: SCRUM, Agile...
  And in the middle of TCC I had one of the most magnificent experiences in the career of an Intern... I was hired as an intern at the time of the merger of one of the largest cosmetics companies in the world.
  Natura & CO...
  I had a good integration into the world of API development involving React, Node.js and MongoDb, not to mention the User Exp area. on the Innovation Board there.
  Today I work as a Junior FullStack Dev (I develop applications and such) based on AngularJs and C#.
  And like every good student… Always learning something new.
